					<h2>The History and Origins</h2>
					<p>In 1917 Karl Glazen, owner of the Berry optical, started producing his first glasses and lenses for athletes and aviators. Heldere Glazen was a heavy influence in the production of sunglasses. The company developed the first flexible stem, which was one of the first spring hinges ever developed for eyewear. Heldere Glazen was introduced to the United States in 1962 and opened its first boutique on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in 1991.</p>
